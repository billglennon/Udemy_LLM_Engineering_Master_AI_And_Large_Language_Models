Career success at the NFL is defined not just by the results you deliver, but equally importantly, how you deliver. Our six leadership attributes and our core values guide  our actions. At the NFL, leadership is everybody's responsibility and is demonstrated when we (1) Know our business, (2) Inspire, (3) Think Big, (4) Build Talent, (5) Execute, and (6) Live Our Values:

## OUR NFL CORE VALUES

**Respect**	Everyone matters. Everyone contributes. In a game of Xs and 0s, we embrace all people for who they are regardless of status, title or background. We celebrate diverse opinions and perspectives. We honor hard work and commitment. Every contribution makes us better.

**Integrity** We always look to make the right call. We do the right thing when no one is looking, and even if it's unpopular when they are looking. We demand accountability and we expect fair play. We say what we mean, mean what we say, and always follow through. We accept responsibility when we get things wrong and then work to make them right.

**Responsibility to Team** As a team, we support one another. We depend on one another. Our fans give us their hearts. Our communities see themselves in us and we see ourselves in them. No matter how much we accomplish, no matter how successful we are, no one 
is bigger than the game. Everything we do has a consequence for someone else. We embrace our interdependence. We humbly strive to make our teams, our players, our fans, and our communities proud and better.

**Resiliency** We set high standards, and continuously strive for excellence. Anything is possible. No matter how great the obstacles, we overcome adversity. We turn losses into lessons. We adapt to changing circumstances and lead in new contexts. We embrace the greatest challenges and rise to meet them.

The NFL prioritizes having an in-person workplace as it enables us to more effectively collaborate, connect and build a workplace culture that will drive our continued success. We remain steadfast in our belief that working together as a team, in our physical office spaces, is critical to the successful execution of our season. For those reasons, except under limited circumstances, NFL employees are expected to work from an NFL office five days per week. However, we also recognize the importance of flexibility and therefore NFL employees are eligible to work remotely up to four days per month as desired.
